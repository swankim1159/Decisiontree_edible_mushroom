# Decision Tree - Edible Mushroom Classifier
A Classifier which can classify edible mushroom
This repository contains a simple decision tree classifier for predicting whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous. 
The project was created for portfolio purposes and uses a small synthetic dataset included directly in the notebook.

## Requirements
The code was written in Python and relies only on a few common packages:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

# Dataset
FOR PORTFOLIO USE ONLY.
None of them are academically verified.

# Progress
Calculate Entrophy
-->Split Dataset
-->Calculate info gain
-->Make the best split
-->Building a tree

Any recent version of Python with these packages installed should be able to run the notebook.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Decision Tree_mushroom.ipynb`.
2. Run all the cells in order to train the decision tree and see the classification steps.
3. The notebook walks through entropy calculation, dataset splitting, information gain and the final tree construction.

## Dataset
The dataset used here is intentionally small and was created solely for demonstration. It is **not** an academically verified dataset.

## Project Progress
- Calculate entropy
- Split dataset
- Calculate information gain
- Make the best split
- Build a tree
